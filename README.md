# Simon Rules
!. Press any key from key board to start the game, the Game Selector choose a color and the Skill Level switch to 1,2, 3 and so on.

2. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color button.

3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

4. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

5. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

6. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
