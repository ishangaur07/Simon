# Simon Rules
Slide the ON/OFF switch to ON, the Game Selector switch to "1" and the Skill Level switch to 1,2, 3 or 4.

Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
